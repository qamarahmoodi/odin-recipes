This project is a collection of recipes built using HTML, showcasing my skills in creating a simple website with multiple pages. As a beginner, I'm excited to have completed my first project using Git and GitHub, which has taught me the importance of version control and collaboration.

Through this project, I've demonstrated my ability to:

Create a basic website structure using HTML
Organize and link multiple pages together
Use Git to track changes and manage different versions of my code
Publish my project on GitHub for others to view
